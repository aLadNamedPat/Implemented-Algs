# Random Implementations from Reading

I've been reading about a lot of things (just a habit of not having a solid direction), and while I think reading a good way to gain exposure to problems, <br/> 
I've realized that my retention rate has been significantly lacking my exposure rate. These implementations are a way to not forget what I read.

I had a lot of running branches and tidbits of this, but this is a merged version that will stay up to date.

## Implementations here
- Thompson Sampling
- RRT algorithms ( all 3 classes)
- RL Implementations of DQN, PPO, DDPG, TD3 
- MARL Implementations of IPPO, MAPPO, MADDPG (In Progress)
